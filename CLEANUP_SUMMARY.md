# Code Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive code cleanup performed to optimize the ServiceFlow codebase, removing dead code, optimizing imports, standardizing types, and ensuring perfect functionality.

## Changes Made

### 🗑️ **Files Removed**
- `app/features/technician-matching/page.tsx` - Replaced with auto-calling feature
- `app/features/real-time-status-updates/page.tsx` - Duplicate of real-time-updates page
- `app/signup/page.tsx` - Redundant, replaced with dedicated free-trial page

### 🏗️ **Type System Optimization**
- **Created**: `types/index.ts` - Centralized TypeScript types and interfaces
- **Standardized**: All interfaces for User, TrialUser, API responses, security, and email
- **Improved**: Type safety across all components and API routes
- **Eliminated**: Duplicate type definitions across files

### 🔧 **API Route Improvements**
- **Unified Security**: All API routes now use centralized security headers and rate limiting
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- **Input Validation**: Enhanced input sanitization and validation across all endpoints
- **Rate Limiting**: Integrated centralized rate limiting system

### 📦 **Import Optimization**
- **Cleaned**: Removed unused imports across all files
- **Centralized**: Moved to centralized type imports from `@/types`
- **Optimized**: React Icons imports to only include used icons
- **Standardized**: Import ordering and structure

### 🛡️ **Security Enhancements**
- **Integrated**: Centralized security utilities across all API routes
- **Standardized**: Rate limiting, input sanitization, and CSRF protection
- **Enhanced**: Password validation and strength requirements
- **Unified**: Security headers applied to all API responses

### 🎨 **Code Quality Improvements**
- **Removed**: Dead code and unused functions
- **Standardized**: Code formatting and structure
- **Enhanced**: Error handling and user feedback
- **Optimized**: Component structure and organization
